    The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system. It is an almost perfect spherical ball of plasma,
    primarily composed of hydrogen (approximately 73%) and helium (approximately 25%). In the Sun's core,
    nuclear fusion occurs, where hydrogen is fused into helium. This fusion releases enormous amounts of energy,
    mainly as light and heat, which makes life on Earth possible. The surface temperature of the Sun is about
    5,500째C, while the core temperature is estimated at around 15 million째C. The Sun has a diameter of about 1.39
    million kilometers, roughly 109 times that of Earth. Its mass constitutes about 99.86% of the total mass of the
    solar system. Sunlight takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth. Without the Sun, there would be
    no liquid water and likely no life on our planet. Solar activity, including sunspots and solar flares, varies
    over an approximately 11-year cycle.
